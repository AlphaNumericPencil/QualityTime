    <p>
      Monikers are cute little pals who will keep you company during normal
      computer use. Let your moniker hang out on one of your unused monitors, or
      take them with you on your phone!
    </p>
    <p>
      Monikers are just like a real pet. They will welcome you online, relax
      with you, and play fun games with you that will allow you to customize
      your Moniker and their enviornment! Collect a bunch of Monkiers!
